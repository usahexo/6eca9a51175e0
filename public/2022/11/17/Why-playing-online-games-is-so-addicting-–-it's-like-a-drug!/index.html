According to a study by the Entertainment Software Association, 65 percent of all Americans play video games, and that number continues to grow. So why is it that we can’t seem to get enough of these virtual worlds?</p>
<p>It turns out that video gaming can be as addictive as drugs. In fact, scientists have found that playing video games releases dopamine in the brain in a similar way to drugs like cocaine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for pleasure and addiction, which is why gaming can be so addictive.</p>
<p>Gamers often describe the feeling of getting into a game as being “in the zone.” This state is caused by the release of dopamine and other neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and endorphins. These chemicals create a type of euphoria that can be very hard to resist.</p>
<p>This addiction can be a real problem for gamers. Studies have shown that video game addiction can lead to problems with school or work, social isolation, and health problems. In extreme cases, it can even lead to death.</p>
<p>So what can you do if you find yourself addicted to video games? The first step is to admit that you have a problem. Then you need to make a plan to address the issue. This may include cutting back on how much time you spend playing games, setting rules for yourself about when and how long you can play, or finding other activities to replace gaming time.</p>
<p>If you find that you are unable to cut back on your gaming despite your best efforts, it may be time to seek professional help. There are many therapists who specialize in treating video game addiction. With professional help, you can learn how to manage your addiction and start leading a healthier life.</p>
<h1 id="The-online-gaming-addiction-that’s-ruining-lives"><a href="#The-online-gaming-addiction-that’s-ruining-lives" class="headerlink" title="The online gaming addiction that’s ruining lives"></a>The online gaming addiction that’s ruining lives</h1><p>Parents are becoming increasingly concerned about the amount of time their children spend online, and for good reason. Too much screen time can have a negative impact on physical health, social skills, and academic performance. But for some people, spending too much time online can be a sign of a more serious problem: addiction.</p>
<p>An addiction to online gaming can have devastating consequences for both the addict and their loved ones. The addict becomes isolated from the real world as they spend more and more time playing games, often neglecting responsibilities such as school or work. They may also start to experience negative physical and psychological effects, including problems with sleep and mood swings.</p>
<p>Gaming addiction can also ruin relationships. Addicts may end up neglecting loved ones in favour of their virtual friends or becoming hostile and defensive when questioned about their excessive gaming habits.</p>
<p>There is help available for those affected by gaming addiction, but it’s often best to seek professional help before things spiral out of control. family therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be very effective in treating gaming addiction.</p>
<p>If you’re worried that your child is addicted to online gaming, there are some signs to look out for:</p>
<p>-They’re spending more time than usual playing games<br>-They’re isolating themselves from friends and family members-They’re having trouble at school or work-They’ve developed problems with sleep or mood-Their game obsession is causing conflict within the family</p>
<h1 id="Why-Gaming-can-be-addictive-and-destructive"><a href="#Why-Gaming-can-be-addictive-and-destructive" class="headerlink" title="Why Gaming can be addictive and destructive"></a>Why Gaming can be addictive and destructive</h1><p>Video gaming can have benefits and drawbacks. It is addictive and destructive for some people.</p>
<p>Video gaming can improve problem-solving skills, reaction time and hand-eye coordination. People who play video games often have better fine motor skills and are able to think faster. Some video games also promote teamwork and socializing.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-know-if-you’re-addicted-to-playing-online-games"><a href="#How-to-know-if-you’re-addicted-to-playing-online-games" class="headerlink" title="How to know if you’re addicted to playing online games"></a>How to know if you’re addicted to playing online games</h1><p>Online gaming can be enjoyable and a great way to pass the time, but it can also be addictive. If you’re not sure whether or not you’re addicted to playing online games, ask yourself the following questions.</p>
<p>Do you spend more time playing games than you intended?</p>
<p>Do you feel like you need to play games to feel good?</p>
<p>Do you get agitated or annoyed when someone interrupts your game-playing?</p>
<p>Do you feel the need to play more and more games as time goes on?</p>
<p>Do you neglect other activities or obligations in favor of gaming?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to two or more of these questions, there’s a good chance that you’re addicted to online gaming. If this is the case, it’s important to seek help and address the issue.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why people become addicted to online gaming. One common reason is that people use games as an escape from reality. They may be dealing with stress or problems in their personal life, and gaming provides an outlet for them. This can lead to an addiction because people become so absorbed in the game that they lose sight of reality.</p>
<p>Another reason people may become addicted to online gaming is because it provides a sense of accomplishment or mastery. People may enjoy feeling like they’re the best at a game and getting positive feedback from others. This can lead to an addiction because people start to rely on the high they get from playing games and begin to neglect other aspects of their life.</p>

Here are some signs."></a>Is your child addicted to playing video games? Here are some signs.</h1><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has released updated guidelines for the diagnosis and management of children’s video game addiction. The report, published in the journal Pediatrics, makes several recommendations to help pediatricians and parents identify and address video game addiction.</p>
<p>According to the new guidelines, pediatricians should ask patients about their video game habits as part of routine screenings. Parents should also be aware of the signs that their child may be addicted to video games.</p>
<p>Symptoms of video game addiction include spending excessive amounts of time playing games, neglecting personal hygiene or other responsibilities, lying about how much time is spent playing games, and becoming irritable or angry when unable to play.</p>
<p>The new guidelines also recommend that parents create a family media plan that includes rules about how much time is allowed to be spent on screens each day and what types of content are allowed.</p>
<p>“We know that there can be negative consequences to screen time, including social media and video games,” said Dr. Dimitri Christakis, one of the authors of the guidelines report. “We want families to be mindful about how much screen time is appropriate for each individual and to balance digital media with other activities.”</p>
<p>Christakis added that pediatricians should not only counsel families on healthy screen habits but should also be prepared to refer children with more serious addictions for treatment.</p>
