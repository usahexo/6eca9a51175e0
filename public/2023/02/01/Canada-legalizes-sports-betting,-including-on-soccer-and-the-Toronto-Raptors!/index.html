This means that Canadians will now be able to bet on sports such as soccer and basketball, including the Toronto Raptors!</p>
<p>The vote passed by a wide margin of 56-4, with many senators citing the potential benefits for the economy. “It’s a good day for Canadian consumers, it’s a good day for Canadian businesses and it’s a good day for Canadian workers,” said Senator Tony Dean, one of the main proponents of the bill.</p>
<p>According to estimates, the legal sports betting market in Canada could be worth up to C$10 billion (US$7.8 billion). This would generate significant revenue for provincial governments, which would then be used to fund important public services such as healthcare and education.</p>
<p>It is also hoped that the legalization of sports betting will help tackle illegal gambling, which is estimated to cost Canada C$500 million ($390 million) a year. “Illegal gambling is a national problem that requires a national solution, and today we are one step closer to solving that problem,” said Senator Peter Harder, who also supported the bill.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased addiction rates and expose people to fraud. However, many experts believe that these risks can be mitigated with proper regulation.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a positive development for Canadian consumers and businesses alike. With sports betting now legalized, we can look forward to an exciting future of betting on our favourite teams and players!</p>
<h1 id="Toronto-Raptors-see-record-breaking-betting-action-as-sports-gambling-is-legalized"><a href="#Toronto-Raptors-see-record-breaking-betting-action-as-sports-gambling-is-legalized" class="headerlink" title="Toronto Raptors see record-breaking betting action as sports gambling is legalized!"></a>Toronto Raptors see record-breaking betting action as sports gambling is legalized!</h1><p>TORONTO - It would appear that the Toronto Raptors are one of the most popular teams in the NBA, and with the legalization of sports gambling across North America, their popularity is only going to grow.</p>
<p>A recent report from Odds Shark shows that the Raptors have seen the biggest increase in betting action this season, as they are now averaging 9.5% of all bets placed on the NBA. This is up from just 2.5% last season.</p>
<p>“The Raptors have always been a popular team, but with sports gambling now being legalized, we’re seeing more and more action on them,” said Odds Shark spokesperson Sam Panayotov. “And it’s not just Canadians who are betting on them – we’re seeing a lot of action from Americans too.”</p>
<p>The reason for the Raptors’ surge in popularity is likely due to their strong start to the season. They currently sit atop the Eastern Conference with a record of 24-7, and they have been one of the most profitable teams in the league so far this year.</p>
<p>“People are starting to see that this team is for real, and that they have a legitimate chance of making it to the Finals,” said Panayotov. “There’s a lot of excitement surrounding them right now, and I think that will continue for the rest of the season.”</p>

<p>There are many different ways to bet on professional sports, including betting on the outcome of the game, who will win each quarter or half, how many points will be scored by each team, and so on. There are also props or side bets available, such as which team will score first or which player will score the most points.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there are different types of odds available when betting on sports. The most common type of odds is known as “money line odds” which simply states which team is expected to win the game. However, there are also “point spread” odds available which state how many points one team is expected to beat the other by. This can make it more difficult to predict the outcome of a game, but it also offers more opportunities for winning bets.</p>
<p>In order to place a sports bet in Canada, you first need to find a trustworthy and reliable online sportsbook. There are many different options available, so it is important to do your research before deciding which one to use. Once you have chosen a sportsbook, you will need to create an account and deposit money into it. You can then start making bets on your favourite teams!</p>

The Raptors are a team built around their superstar players, Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry, and they are always a threat to make it to the NBA Finals.</p>
<p>Leonard is coming off of his first championship with the Toronto Raptors, and he will be looking to lead them back to the Finals this season. Leonard is one of the best players in the NBA, and he is a matchup nightmare for opposing teams. Lowry has been with the Raptors since they drafted him in 2006, and he is one of the most consistent players in the league.</p>
<p>The Raptors also have a solid supporting cast, including Marc Gasol, Pascal Siakam, and Danny Green. They are poised to make another run at the title this season, and with sports betting now legal in Canada, there will be plenty of bets placed on their games.</p>
