#  Why playing online games is so addicting – it's like a drug!

Video gaming is one of the most popular and addicting activities on the planet. According to a study by the Entertainment Software Association, 65 percent of all Americans play video games, and that number continues to grow. So why is it that we can't seem to get enough of these virtual worlds?

It turns out that video gaming can be as addictive as drugs. In fact, scientists have found that playing video games releases dopamine in the brain in a similar way to drugs like cocaine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for pleasure and addiction, which is why gaming can be so addictive.

Gamers often describe the feeling of getting into a game as being "in the zone." This state is caused by the release of dopamine and other neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and endorphins. These chemicals create a type of euphoria that can be very hard to resist.

This addiction can be a real problem for gamers. Studies have shown that video game addiction can lead to problems with school or work, social isolation, and health problems. In extreme cases, it can even lead to death.

This may include cutting back on how much time you spend playing games, setting rules for yourself about when and how long you can play, or finding other activities to replace gaming time.

If you find that you are unable to cut back on your gaming despite your best efforts, it may be time to seek professional help. There are many therapists who specialize in treating video game addiction. With professional help, you can learn how to manage your addiction and start leading a healthier life.

#  Is your child addicted to playing video games? Here are some signs.

The American Academy of Pediatrics has released updated guidelines for the diagnosis and management of children’s video game addiction. The report, published in the journal Pediatrics, makes several recommendations to help pediatricians and parents identify and address video game addiction.

According to the new guidelines, pediatricians should ask patients about their video game habits as part of routine screenings. Parents should also be aware of the signs that their child may be addicted to video games.

Symptoms of video game addiction include spending excessive amounts of time playing games, neglecting personal hygiene or other responsibilities, lying about how much time is spent playing games, and becoming irritable or angry when unable to play.

The new guidelines also recommend that parents create a family media plan that includes rules about how much time is allowed to be spent on screens each day and what types of content are allowed.

“We know that there can be negative consequences to screen time, including social media and video games,” said Dr. Dimitri Christakis, one of the authors of the guidelines report. “We want families to be mindful about how much screen time is appropriate for each individual and to balance digital media with other activities.”

Christakis added that pediatricians should not only counsel families on healthy screen habits but should also be prepared to refer children with more serious addictions for treatment.
