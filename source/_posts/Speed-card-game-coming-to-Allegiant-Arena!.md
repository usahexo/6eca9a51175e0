#  How to play Speed with cards: the casino game for beginners

Speed, also known as Spit or Slam, is a fast-paced card game that can be played with anywhere from two to eight players. The game is especially popular in casinos, where it is often played as a betting game. The basic premise of the game is to collect as many cards as possible until you can go out.

The first player starts by flipping over the top card of their deck-this is their starter card. The next player then flips over the next card. If this card matches the starter card, the player captures both cards and sets them in front of them. If the cards do not match, the player either captures nothing or picks up another card from the deck and adds it to their hand.

If at any time a player flips over a card that matches the starter card of another player, they immediately capture all of that player's cards and set them in front of themselves. The first player to lose all their cards (or with no cards left in their deck) loses the game.

One important rule to keep in mind when playing Speed is that when you go out, you must put your final card down on the table face up so everyone can see it. This means that other players will know how many cards are left in your hand and can try to play an appropriate number of cards to block you if they suspect you're going out on a particular turn.

Here are some basic tips for beginners who are new to Speed:

-Start by flipping over the top card of your deck and laying it down on the table. This will be your starter card for the round.

-Make sure to keep track of which cards have been flipped over already, as this will help you remember what's still available.

-When flipping over a new card, check to see if it matches your starter card. If it does, capture both cards and set them in front of you. If it doesn't match, either capture nothing or take another card from the deck and add it to your hand.

-If at any time you flip over a card that matches another player's starter card, capture all of that player's cards and set them in front of yourself.


-If you have no more cards left in your deck, put your final card face up on the table so everyone can see it and announce "Out!" This signals the end of your turn and players will now start flipping over their own remaining cards to see if they can capture anything.

-The first player to lose all their cards (or with no cards left in their deck) loses the game

#  Learn how to play Speed with cards like a casino pro!

If you love playing casino games then you're probably familiar with the game of Speed. This fast-paced card game is one of the most popular options on the casino floor, and it can be enjoyed by players of all ages. Whether you're a beginner or a pro, these tips will help you up your Speed game and make you a casino champion!

# 1: Learn the basic rules

The first step to becoming a Speed master is to learn the basic rules of the game. This simple guide will teach you everything you need to know to get started.

# 2: Know your cards

In Speed, each player is dealt five cards. It's important to know what each card represents so that you can make quick decisions during the game. The suits are Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades, and the ranks are Ace through 10. In addition, there are three special cards - the Jack (J), Queen (Q), and King (K). These are known as court cards.

# 3: Cut the deck

Before starting a round of Speed, both players should cut the deck so that neither knows which card is at the bottom. This helps to ensure a fair game.

# 4: Bet smart

One of the best things about Speed is that it's a relatively low-stakes game. This means that you can bet lower amounts without risking too much money. Be careful not to bet too high though - if you lose all your chips, you'll have to leave the table!

# 5: Play with strategy

Speed is a strategic game that can be won or lost depending on how well you play your cards. Pay attention to what your opponent is doing and try to anticipate their next move. This will give you an advantage in the game.
