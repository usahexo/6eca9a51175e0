#  How to Play Bonus Poker for Twice the Fun and Rewards!

Welcome to the exciting world of Bonus Poker! This version of video poker is twice as much fun as the traditional game and offers bigger rewards, making it a favourite for many casino players. In order to get the most out of Bonus Poker, it’s important to understand how the game works and how to make the most of your bets. Here’s a guide on how to play Bonus Poker and some tips on how to win.

The basic rules of Bonus Poker are the same as regular video poker. You are dealt five cards face up and you must decide which ones to hold and which ones to discard. The aim is to create the best possible five-card hand from the cards that remain. After you have made your choices, the computer will reveal which cards were replaced and give you your final hand ranking. The highest ranking hand wins the bet.

In Bonus Poker, however, there are four bonus payouts depending on the rank of your final hand. These payouts are doubled compared to regular video poker, making them particularly lucrative in this game. The following table shows the bonus payouts for each rank:

Hand Payout Royal flush 1000x Bet 4 aces with 2, 3 or 4 at kicker 400x Bet Straight flush 50x Bet Four of a kind 25x Bet Full house 9x Bet Flush 6x Bet Straight 4x Bet Three of a kind 3x Bet Two pair 2x Bet Jacks or better 1x Bet

As you can see, betting on a royal flush can result in a whopping 1000-time return on your investment! So it’s important to make sure you know which hands offer the best potential payouts.

Here are some tips for playing Bonus Poker and maximizing your chances of winning:

- Make sure you keep track of the different payout tables for each hand rank. This will help you decide which hands to aim for in order to maximize your profits.

- Be aware that while doubles payouts increase your potential profits, they also increase the risk factor. So make sure you only bet what you can afford to lose.

- Always play with optimal strategy for maximum chances of winning. There are plenty of online guides available that can teach you how to play like a pro!

#  Enjoy Twice the Fun When Playing Bonus Poker Games!

If you're looking for ways to supercharge your poker playing experience, bonus poker variations are a great way to do it! This type of game offers twice the excitement and potential profits compared to traditional poker games. Let's take a closer look at what makes bonus poker so much fun.

First and foremost, bonus poker games offer players the chance to win extra money on top of the usual payouts. This is accomplished by awarding a bonus payout for certain combinations of cards. For instance, in Deuces Wild bonus poker, players who are dealt a natural four-of-a-kind (deuces being wild cards) will win an extra prize. This can be a lot of fun, especially when you hit the jackpot!

Another thing that makes bonus poker games so exciting is the added layer of strategy that they require. Since there are more potential winning combinations, you'll need to be more thoughtful about each move you make. This makes for a more engaging experience, and it also helps to keep the game moving at a brisk pace.

Finally, bonus poker games just offer more bang for your buck overall. Not only do you have the chance to win extra money on top of your regular payouts, but the gameplay itself is more exciting and strategic. If you're looking for a new way to enjoy online poker, be sure to check out the many different bonus poker variants available today!
