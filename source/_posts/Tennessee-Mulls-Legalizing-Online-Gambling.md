#  Tennessee Mulls Legalizing Online Gambling

Tennessee is one of the latest states to consider legalizing online gambling. A measure that would allow Tennesseans to gamble on the internet has been introduced in the state legislature.

Under the proposed legislation, Tennesseans could place bets on sporting events, play casino games, and bet on horse races online. The bill would establish a regulatory framework for online gambling, and would allow the Tennessee Gaming Commission to oversee and regulate the industry.

Supporters of the measure say that it would generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state. They argue that allowing Tennesseans to gamble online would help to create jobs and stimulate the economy.

Opponents of the measure say that it could lead to addiction and social ills. They also argue that it would be difficult to regulate and that it could be used by criminals to launder money.

The bill is currently pending in the state legislature. It has not yet been voted on and there is no indication as to whether or not it will pass.

#  Bill to Legalize Online Gambling Introduced in Tennessee Legislature

A bill has been introduced in the Tennessee Legislature that would legalize online gambling within the state.

The measure, House Bill 989, was introduced by Representative Jimmy Matlock earlier this week. The proposed legislation would allow licensed casinos and racetracks in the state to offer online gambling, including casino games, poker, and sports betting.

Residents of Tennessee would be able to gamble online through approved websites, and players would be subject to the same age requirements as land-based gambling. The bill also includes a number of provisions aimed at protecting players, such as limits on how much they can gamble each day and week, as well as restrictions on how much money they can lose each month.

Speaking about the proposed legislation, Rep. Matlock said: "This legislation is about creating jobs and increasing revenue for our state. It will also provide Tennesseans with another option for entertainment."

Online gambling is currently illegal in Tennessee, though there are no laws specifically prohibiting it. This has led to a number of unlicensed and unregulated websites operating in the state. If passed, House Bill 989 would not only legalize online gambling but also establish strict regulations for those sites.

According to Rep. Matlock, there is bipartisan support for the bill, with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle backing it. He added that he hopes the measure will be voted on by the full House soon.

#  Tennessee Could be Next State to Legalize Online Gambling

On Tuesday, a bill was introduced in the Tennessee state legislature that would legalize online gambling within the state. The bill, HB 154, was introduced by Representative from Nashville Brenda Gilmore. This is not the first time that such a bill has been introduced in Tennessee – in fact, a similar bill was introduced last year but it ultimately failed to pass.

If the bill is passed, it would allow for online poker, casino games and sports betting to be offered by licensed operators within the state. It would also establish regulations governing these activities, including age restrictions and minimum gambling ages.

The introduction of the bill follows on the heels of a ruling by the US Supreme Court that overturned a federal law that had banned online gambling. This ruling has paved the way for states to legalize online gambling within their borders. So far, seven states have done so: Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois.

It is unclear at this point whether or not the bill will pass in Tennessee. However, with more and more states moving to legalize online gambling, it seems likely that this trend will continue in the years ahead.

#  Debate over Legalizing Online Gambling Begins in Tennessee

The debate over legalizing online gambling in the state of Tennessee has begun, as two separate bills were proposed to the House Gaming Subcommittee on Tuesday.

The first bill, HB 0198, would legalize online poker and casino games, while the second bill, HB 0299, would legalize only online poker.

Both bills have been referred to the subcommittee for further consideration.

Chris Sprowles, a co-sponsor of HB 0198 and the chairman of the Tennessee Poker Players Alliance, was present at the hearing to testify in support of the bill.

Sprowles said that legalizing online gambling would bring much-needed revenue to Tennessee’s coffers, as well as create jobs. He also noted that regulation of online gambling would help protect consumers from fraud and unscrupulous operators.

Opponents of the bill argued that it could lead to addiction and social ills, and that it was inappropriate to allow gambling over the internet.

No decision was made on either bill on Tuesday, but they will likely be debated further by the subcommittee in the coming weeks.
