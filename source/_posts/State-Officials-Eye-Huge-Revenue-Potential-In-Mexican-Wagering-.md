#  State Officials Eye Huge Revenue Potential In Mexican Wagering 

Officials in several U.S. states are looking south of the border for a potential new revenue stream, as they contemplate legalizing wagering on Mexican horse races.

Proponents of the move say that it could bring in tens of millions of dollars in new annual revenue for state coffers, as bettors place their money on races taking place just over the border in Mexico.

To date, lawmakers in at least six states have expressed interest in allowing such betting, including New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. And while there has been some pushback from racing interests who stand to lose out on betting revenues if such wagering were to be legalized, the prospect of new tax revenues is likely to outweigh those concerns.

In 2015, a study by the National Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association found that legalizing wagering on Mexican races could generate anywhere from $37 million to $76 million annually in new tax revenue for states. That estimate was based on legal wagering on just 10 percent of all Mexican races.

"The potential is there for a lot of tax revenue to be generated," said Alex Waldrop, president and CEO of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association. "We would welcome it."

Pennsylvania is one state where legislators are actively considering legislation that would legalize wagering on Mexican races. A report prepared for the state' House Gaming Oversight Committee estimated that allowing betting on those races could bring in up to $24 million annually in new tax revenue.

"There is an awful lot of money flowing across our borders illegally already," said committee chairman Rep. John Payne. "If we can capture some of that money and put it into the Commonwealth's coffers, I think that is a good thing."

#  Mexican Gaming Industry On The Rise 

The Mexican gaming industry is on the rise, as more and more people are interested in playing casino games. In fact, a recent study by the Gaming Authority of Mexico revealed that the gaming industry is now worth $2.7 billion, and it continues to grow at a rate of 5% each year.

There are many reasons for this growth, but one of the main drivers is the increasing popularity of online casinos. People can now play their favourite casino games from anywhere in the world, and they no longer have to travel to Las Vegas or Monte Carlo to enjoy the thrill of gambling.

Another reason for the growth of the Mexican gaming industry is the increasing number of tourists who visit Mexico each year. Many of these tourists enjoy spending time at Mexican casinos, and they are helping to drive up revenues.

Finally, there has been a significant increase in investment in the gaming industry over the past few years. This has led to new casino resorts being built across Mexico, which is attracting even more players to the market.

All of these factors are contributing to the rapid growth of Mexico’s gaming industry, and it is likely that this trend will continue for many years to come.

#  Why States Allow Wagering Mexico 

States have different ways of sanctioning and governing gambling within their jurisdictions. There are three ways in which to allow gambling: by federal law, by state law or by tribal compact. 

The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) was established in 1988 to protect Native American tribes who were using gaming as a means to generate revenue for essential government operations. The IGRA specifically requires that any gaming activity conducted by a tribe must be authorized by the individual state in which the tribe is located. This act gives states the option to allow or prohibit gaming on Indian lands. In 1991, the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) was created as an independent regulatory agency within the Department of the Interior to ensure that tribes are operated in a fair and responsible manner. The NIGC is also responsible for approving management contracts for Class II gaming activity. 

There are three types of class II gaming: bingo, pull tabs/instant bingo, and card games played at tribal casinos with cards such as blackjack, poker, and Crazy 4 Poker ® . Class III gaming activities, such as slot machines and casino Texas hold’em, are considered high-stakes gambling and are only allowed on certain reservations after receiving approval from the state in which the tribe is located.

Federal Law

The federal government has a limited role in gambling regulation because it is seen as a states’ rights issue. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) of 2006 was enacted to prevent financial institutions from processing payments for online gambling sites. However, this act does not make online gambling illegal; it simply makes it more difficult for players to fund their online wagers. The UIGEA affects all forms of online gambling but has had a more significant impact on poker than any other form of wagering due to its social nature. In 2011, the Department of Justice issued a memorandum that stated that the Wire Act only prohibits sports betting over telecommunications wires and does not apply to other forms of online gambling such as casino games and poker. 

State Law

Each state has its own laws regulating gambling within its borders. Some states allow any type of gambling while others have more restrictive laws that only permit specific types of gaming or exclude certain types of players (such as those under 18 years old). For example, Nevada allows most forms of gambling while Connecticut only permits pari-mutuel wagering on horse races. 

Tribal Compact 
A tribal compact is an agreement between a state and one or more tribes that allows certain types of Class III gaming on Indian lands within the state. These agreements must be authorized by the state legislature and typically require the payment of a percentage of revenue generated from gaming activities back to the state. In order for a tribe to offer Class III gaming, it must first enter into a compact with the state in which it is located. As of 2019, there are 38 states with active tribal compacts authorizing some form of Class III gaming .

#  Gambling In Mexico: A Lucrative but Unregulated Business 

Mexico has a long and storied history with gambling, going back to pre-Columbian times. Today, gambling is a multi-billion-dollar industry in Mexico, but it remains largely unregulated. This has led to a number of problems, including money laundering, organized crime, and addiction.

Despite its problems, gambling is big business in Mexico. The Mexican Gaming Commission (CGM) estimated that the gambling industry was worth 134.8 billion pesos (US$7.2 billion) in 2016. This includes casino gaming, sports betting, lotteries, and charitable gaming. 

Gambling is especially popular in Mexico City and the states of Baja California Sur, Jalisco, and Quintana Roo. The CGM estimates that 78 percent of the Mexican population participates in some form of gambling each year. 

The main problem with gambling in Mexico is its lack of regulation. There are no universal standards for determining who can operate a casino or other gambling establishment. This has led to a number of problems, including money laundering and organized crime. In addition, there are no age restrictions on gambling, which has led to addiction problems among minors. 

Another issue is that the rules governing casino operations are often vague or contradictory. This has made it difficult for casinos to know what is allowed and what isn't. As a result, many casinos engage in illegal activities such as loan sharking and money laundering to make up for the profits they're losing from the unclear regulations. 

The government has been trying to address these issues by enacting new regulations. For example, in December 2017 the government announced plans to create a new regulatory body specifically for casinos. However, these efforts have been hampered by opposition from powerful lobbying groups such as the casino operators themselves. 

Despite its problems, gambling remains a lucrative industry in Mexico. With better regulation, this industry could be made more safe and accountable for the benefit of all Mexicans

#  Despite Risks, States Opt to Allow Wagering in Mexico

When it comes to gambling, Mexico is a bit of a wild west. While there are restrictions in place, there are also large loopholes that allow Mexicans to wager on just about anything. And while this has created problems for the government, they have thus far been unwilling to clamp down too hard on the industry.

The biggest problem for the government is that, with few exceptions, gambling is not regulated in Mexico. This means that there is no way to ensure that those who are wagering are doing so in a responsible manner. It also means that there is little oversight when it comes to how the casinos and other gambling establishments are run. This has led to instances of corruption and organized crime activity in the industry.

In addition, there is very little tax revenue generated from gambling in Mexico. This is because most of the betting takes place underground, with no taxes being paid on the winnings. This means that the government is missing out on a significant amount of potential revenue.

Despite all of these issues, the Mexican government has been reluctant to clamp down on gambling. One reason for this may be that many politicians and their families have ties to the industry. In addition, many voters see gambling as a way to make some extra money, and they are unlikely to support any efforts by the government to restrict it.

So far, only a few states in Mexico have opted to legalize and regulate gambling. This has been done in an effort to generate more tax revenue for the state and to bring some controls to the industry. But even these states have struggled with regulating gambling. There have been reports of corruption and organized crime activity in some of these casinos as well.

It remains to be seen whether or not Mexico will ever fully regulate its gambling industry. Given all of the problems that have arisen thus far, it seems unlikely that this will happen anytime soon. However, until there is more regulation in place, it looks like gambling will continue to be a big business in Mexico – with all of the associated risks
