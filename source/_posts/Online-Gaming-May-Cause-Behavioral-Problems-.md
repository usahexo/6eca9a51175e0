# Online Gaming May Cause Behavioral Problems 

A recent study published in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i> suggests that there may be a link between online gaming and behavioral problems in teenagers. The study found that those who played games for more than three hours per day were more likely to exhibit symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including problems with focus, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness.

The study was conducted by surveying 2,500 teenagers aged 14 to 17 about their gaming habits and symptoms of ADHD. Nearly one-fifth of participants reported playing video games for more than three hours per day, and they were more likely to have ADHD symptoms than those who played for less time or not at all. Boys were more likely than girls to exhibit problem behaviors, regardless of how much they game.

Though the study does not prove that online gaming causes ADHD, it provides strong evidence that there may be a correlation between the two. Experts say that further research is needed to determine if excessive gaming is actually causing the problems or if troubled teens are simply more likely to game for hours on end.

It is important to note that not all video games are created equal; some can actually improve cognitive skills and academic performance. So while parents should take precautions against excessive gaming, it is not necessarily cause for alarm unless there are noticeable negative effects on a teenager's behavior or schoolwork.

# Are You At Risk For Gambling Addiction If You Play Online Games? 

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can affect anyone. While the stereotype of a gambling addict is someone who frequents casinos and bets on sports, any type of gambling can lead to addiction. This includes playing online games that involve betting or earning in-game rewards.

If you find yourself spending more and more time playing online games that involve betting or earning rewards, you may be at risk for gambling addiction. Some warning signs include: 

- Feeling irritable or restless when you can't play
- Telling lies to family or friends about how much money you've won or lost
- Hiding your gambling activity from others
- Feeling guilty or ashamed about your gambling
- Spending more money than you can afford on gambling
- Neglecting work, school, or personal responsibilities to gamble
- Suffering anxiety or depression as a result of your gambling

If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it's important to get help. Gamblers Anonymous is a 12 step program that can provide support for those struggling with addiction. There are also rehab centers and therapy groups specifically for those with gambling addictions.

# Problem Gaming Detrimental To Mental Health 

Problem gaming can have a detrimental effect on mental health. Those who are already predisposed to anxiety and other mental health conditions can be severely impacted by too much gaming.

Symptoms of problem gaming can include: feeling like you have to play games all the time, feeling anxious or angry when you can't play, cancelling plans with friends or activities you enjoy in order to game, lying about how much you game or how long you've been playing for, obsessively thinking about games when not playing them and suffering from withdrawal symptoms when not able to game.

People with problem gaming often become socially isolated and struggle to maintain healthy relationships. Their work or school may also suffer as a result of their excessive gaming habits. Many people with problem gaming struggle to admit they have a problem and need help, instead trying to fix things themselves.

If you recognise any of these signs in yourself or someone else, it is important to seek professional help. Gaming addiction is a real condition and can be treated effectively with therapy and/or medication if necessary.

# Study Shows That Internet Gaming Disorder Is Real 

A recent study published in the journal <i>PLoS One</i> has found that Internet Gaming Disorder is a real condition that affects people all over the world. 

The study, which was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Bonn in Germany, looked at data from nearly 4,000 men and women who had been diagnosed with Internet Gaming Disorder. The participants were asked to complete a survey that asked about their symptoms of addiction, including how often they experienced cravings for gaming, how much time they spent gaming each day, and whether they had any problems with their personal or professional lives as a result of their gaming habits. 

The results of the study showed that Internet Gaming Disorder is a real condition that affects people all over the world. In fact, the study found that more than half of the participants met the criteria for addiction to gaming. Additionally, the study found that people who suffer from Internet Gaming Disorder are more likely to experience problems with personal relationships, professional lives, and mental health. 

The findings of this study are important because they provide scientific evidence that Internet Gaming Disorder is real and should be taken seriously. The results of this study could lead to more recognition of this disorder and may help to pave the way for better treatment options for those affected by it.

# Online Gaming Can Lead To Serious Problem Gambling

Problem gambling, or pathological gambling, is a relatively new term used to describe a condition in which people gamble compulsively, to the point where their personal and professional lives are adversely affected. The problem gambler may experience intense cravings for gambling, make repeated unsuccessful attempts to stop gambling, and suffer significant emotional, social and financial consequences as a result of their addiction.

Due to its recent identification as a standalone disorder, not much is known about pathological gambling. What is known, however, is that it is a growing problem. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), problem gambling rates have doubled in the past decade, and studies suggest that up to 2% of Americans – or nearly 6 million people – may be affected by pathological gambling.

There are many factors that can contribute to problem gambling, but online gaming is emerging as one of the most significant. With the increasing popularity of online gaming platforms such as Xbox Live and PlayStation Network – not to mention the ever-growing number of mobile gaming apps – it’s no surprise that more and more people are developing addictions to these activities. In fact, a study conducted by GamCare UK found that over half of all problem gamblers reported playing casino games online, while one-third admitted to spending more time on games than they intended.

Whether you’re playing casino games, racing cars or battling enemies in a fantasy world, online gaming can be extremely addictive and potentially damaging. If you or someone you know might be suffering from a problem with online gaming, here are some steps you can take:

– Seek professional help: If you feel like you’ve lost control over your gaming habits and they’re causing problems in your life, it’s important to seek professional help. There are many qualified therapists who specialize in helping people overcome addiction disorders; finding one who can help with your specific situation is key.

– Talk to someone you trust: It can also be helpful to talk openly about your addiction with someone you trust – whether it’s a friend or family member – so they can better understand what you’re going through. This support system will be important as you work through your recovery.

– Set boundaries: One way to start taking control of your online gaming habit is by setting boundaries for yourself. Decide how much time you want/need to spend playing each day (or week) and stick to it. Putting limitations on your gaming time can help reduce temptation and prevent unhealthy patterns from developing.

– Stay active: When you’re spending most of your free time sitting in front of a computer or console, it’s easy for your body (and mind) to become stagnant. To counteract this, try to stay active outside of your gaming sessions; get out and explore nature, go for walks or bike rides with friends, etc. Exercise has been shown to improve mental health and well-being overall.
