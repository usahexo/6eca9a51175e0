#  How many English submarines are in service?

The United Kingdom operates a fleet of nuclear submarines and conventional submarines. The Royal Navy currently has ten ballistic missile submarines and four nuclear-powered attack submarines in service. As of 2019, the UK has no plans to replace its ballistic missile submarine fleet.

#  What is the displacement of the smallest English submarine?

The displacement of the smallest English submarine is 210 tons. It is also the most maneuverable submarine in the Royal Navy.

#  What was the first English submarine to be lost in combat?

The first English submarine to be lost in combat was HMS E9. On October 13, 1914, the submarine was on a reconnaissance mission off the Dutch coast when it hit a German mine and sank. Of the crew of 18, only two survived.

#  How long can English submarines remain submerged?

English submarines are some of the most advanced in the world. They are able to stay submerged for extended periods of time, allowing them to undetected by their opponents. How long can they remain submerged though?

The average submerged endurance of an English submarine is around 24 days. However, newer submarines are able to stay submerged for longer periods of time. The Astute-class submarines, for example, have an endurance of around a month.

One reason for the increased endurance of modern submarines is the development of air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. These systems allow the submarine to generate power without having to surface or use its diesel engines. This allows the submarine to remain submerged even if its batteries run out.

The continued development of AIP systems is likely to increase the submerged endurance of English submarines even further in the future. This will allow them to stay undetected and conduct covert operations for longer periods of time.

#  What is the top speed of English submarines?

The top speed of an English submarine is around 35 mph (56 km/h). They are not the fastest submarines in the world, but they are still incredibly quick and can travel long distances quickly.

There are several different types of English submarines, each with its own unique capabilities. The Astute-class submarines, for example, are some of the most advanced in the world and can reach speeds of up to 35 mph.

The older Trafalgar-class submarines can reach speeds of up to 30 mph, while the Vanguard-class submarines can reach speeds of up to 25 mph.

All of these submarines use a water jet propulsion system that allows them to travel quickly through the water. This system works by using high pressure water to create a jet that propels the submarine forwards.

This system is very efficient and allows the submarines to travel at high speeds without using a lot of energy. It also helps them to stay stealthy underwater and avoid detection from enemies.

The top speed of an English submarine may not be as fast as some other types of submarines, but it is still more than enough to help them travel quickly and discreetly through the water.
