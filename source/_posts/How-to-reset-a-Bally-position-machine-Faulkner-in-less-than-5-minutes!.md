#  How to reset a Bally position machine Faulkner in less than 5 minutes!

Are you looking to reset a Bally position machine Faulkner? Do you want to know how to do it in less than 5 minutes? It is actually quite easy and can be done in just a few simple steps.

First, remove the power cord from the back of the machine. This will disconnect it from the wall and will allow you to work on it more easily. Next, locate the small silver screw located on the right side of the cabinet door. Remove this screw and then open the door.

Inside you will find the main PCB (printed circuit board). Locate the three black screws that hold it in place and remove them. Now, disconnect all of the cables from the PCB. There are six total - four at the top and two at the bottom.

Now, turn the PCB over so you are looking at the bottom. You will see a small white plastic box with two green wires coming out of it. This is called the coil driver board. Using a Phillips head screwdriver, remove the eight screws that hold it in place.

Now, carefully remove the coil driver board and set it aside. You can now install your new one by reversing these steps. When you are finished, plug in the power cord and turn on your machine. It should now be reset to factory defaults.

## Introduction

Bally is a big name in the casino gaming industry, and their position machines are among the more popular titles on the floor. If you're looking to add one of these games to your casino collection, or if you're just getting started with Bally position machines, our 5 minute guide is for you!

In this guide, we'll walk you through the basics of setting up and playing a Bally position machine. We'll cover how to insert coins or bills into the machine, how to make wagers, and how to spin the reels.

We'll also show you how to use the game's features - including bonus rounds and payout tables - so you can start winning right away! So let's get started.

## Setting up your machine

First things first: let's take a look at how to set up your Bally position machine. To do this, we'll need to familiarize ourselves with the game's control panel.

The control panel is located in the lower-left corner of the screen and it looks like this:

From left to right, here are what each button on the control panel does:

     - Bet one coin (or bill) per line    - Bet five coins (or bills) per line   - Spin reels (or hold them if betting max)  - Pays out any winning combinations on the screen - Goes back one screen in history (if applicable)  - Goes forward one screen in history (if applicable) - Pauses/resumes game play

 ## Making your bets
Now that we know what each button does, let's take a look at how to make bets on a Bally position machine. Wagers can be made in two ways: by number of lines played, or by total bet amount per spin. Both methods are explained below.

To play one line at a time, press the "-" button until "1" appears on the screen. This will activate one payline on the game. To bet more than one line at a time, press the "+" button until "5" appears onscreen; this will activate all five paylines on the game. Note that you must play all five lines in order to qualify for jackpots and other top-tier prizes.

If you'd rather not worry about activating individual lines, you can also choose to bet by total bet amount by pressing the "Bet Max" button. This will automatically play all five lines at maximum bet size; be aware though that doing this may deplete your bankroll quickly! Selecting this option is a great way to go all-in on a single spin and hopefully score a big win.
