#  What is the RTP of the game? 

The RTP (return to player) of a casino game is the percentage of the money wagered on it that is paid back to players over time. The RTP for most casino games is well above 90%, with some as high as 99%. This means that for every $100 wagered, players can expect to receive at least $90 back – and sometimes substantially more.

The return to player is one of the most important factors to consider when choosing a casino game. Obviously, you want to make sure you’re getting the best chance possible of winning money, so always check the RTP before playing a new game.

While there are many different factors that contribute to how much money you can win while playing casino games, the RTP is by far the most important. Simply put, games with high RTPs offer better chances of winning than games with low RTPs. So if you’re looking to maximize your chances of winning, stick to casino games with high RTPs.

#  How do I play Total Overdrive?

## Introduction

Total Overdrive is a new game created by independent game developer, Sean Kauppinen. The objective of the game is to steer a car through a city while avoiding obstacles and gathering coins. The game has an 8-bit retro style and can be played on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

In order to play Total Overdrive, you will need to download the game from the developer's website and install it on your computer. Then open the game and click on "New Game" to start playing.

The controls for the game are very simple - use the arrow keys on your keyboard to steer the car, and hold down the space bar to accelerate. The further down you press the space bar, the faster the car will go.

The objective of Total Overdrive is to steer your car through a city while avoiding obstacles and gathering coins. You can see how many coins you have collected in the top left corner of the screen, and your current score is shown in the top right corner. There are also power-ups that can be collected which will give you temporary invincibility or increase your speed.

If you collide with an obstacle, your car will spin out and you will lose health. If your health drops to zero, then you will lose one of three lives, and if all three lives are lost then you will have to start again from scratch.

The further you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes as there are more obstacles in your way. But if you manage to complete all 10 levels, then you will be rewarded with a special surprise!
