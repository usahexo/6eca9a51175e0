#  When did Yugoslavia break apart?

The breakup of Yugoslavia began in 1991 and was completed in 1992.

#  What was the main cause of the breakup?

When a couple breaks up, it's often difficult to determine the main cause. In many cases, there are several factors that contribute to the breakup. However, in some cases, the main cause is clear.

In some cases, one partner may have cheated on the other partner. This can be a major cause of frustration and can lead to a breakup. If one partner feels like they can't trust the other person, it can be difficult to maintain the relationship.

Another common cause of breakups is fights and disagreements. If couples argue constantly or can't seem to resolve their differences, it can lead to a breakup.

In some cases, one partner may simply grow tired of the relationship and decide to end it. This can happen for any number of reasons, such as boredom or feeling like the relationship has run its course.

Ultimately, there is no single answer for what causes breakups. Every relationship is different and every couple has their own unique set of problems. However, these are some of the most common causes of breakups.

#  Which republic declared independence first?

The first republic to declare independence was the United States of America. This occurred on July 4, 1776.

#  How bloody was the conflict?

The Crimean War was not only bloody, but it was also devastating. In total, over three-quarters of a million soldiers and sailors were killed, wounded or captured.

The war started on October 5th, 1853, when the Russian Empire declared war on the Ottoman Empire. The Russians had hoped to seize control of the Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, as well as the Black Sea ports.

The war soon spread to other parts of Europe, with France and Britain joining the fight against Russia. The conflict continued for more than two years, with no clear winner emerging. Finally, in March 1856, an agreement was reached that saw the Russians pull out of Crimea.

The Crimean War was one of the deadliest conflicts in European history, and it left a lasting legacy.

#  What happened to the JNA after Yugoslavia broke up?

The JNA, or Yugoslav National Army, served as the military of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. However, when Yugoslavia broke up in 1991, the JNA quickly became embroiled in the conflict.

After Croatia and Slovenia declared independence, Bosnian Serbs proclaimed their own republic, which led to conflict with Bosnia's Muslim population. The JNA sided with the Bosnian Serbs, while Croatia and Slovenia were armed by NATO. This led to a three-year war in which around 100,000 people were killed.

In 1995, NATO launched Operation Deliberate Force, a bombing campaign that aimed to stop the Bosnian Serbs from attacking civilians. The campaign was successful, and in December of that year, a peace agreement was reached. The JNA was disbanded soon afterwards, and its members joined various successor armies.
